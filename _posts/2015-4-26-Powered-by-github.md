It's being a long time since I've carved out some time to spend on my website. While checking the completely outdated website both in content and user experience, I thought that would be great to start blogging about thoughts, ideas, programming; reflecting my personal opinion when it comes to subjective statements. 

The only requirement to deploy the blog was the effort needed to set it up and the ease of posting. And.. tada! GitHub pages in conjunction with jekyll and the cool [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) that includes a fully responsive default theme did the trick for me!

From now on, those thoughts are only a git push away from the web surface.
